## Introduction & motivation

A CSDL document — the XML or JSON you author to describe an OData service — is a
**syntactic tree**. Resolving it (binding every symbolic name to the element it
denotes) yields the **EDM**, which is best understood not as a tree but as a
**semantic graph**: the model's elements are _nodes_, the links between them are
_edges_, and certain attributes describe ordered _paths_ through that graph.

That graph is valuable **as information in its own right**, independent of any
drawing of it. A directed graph of nodes, edges, and paths is a precise,
queryable mathematical structure, and most questions one actually asks of a model
are graph questions:

- _Dependency / impact analysis_ — what references this type; what breaks if I
  remove it; what is reachable from this entity set.
- _Validation_ — does every reference resolve; are there cycles where there
  should be none; do key and binding paths land on legal targets.
- _Diffing_ — how did the graph change between two versions of a model.
- _Documentation and exploration_ — including, as **one consumer among many**,
  the interactive visualizer in `apps/edm-graph`.

This document defines the graph precisely: what becomes a node, what becomes an
edge, and what becomes a path — by classifying every CSDL **attribute** into one
of three categories. That classification currently exists only as tacit knowledge
and in code (the resolver's typed path segments and the graph exporter in
`crates/csdl-edm/src/graph.rs`). It is written down here so the EDM semantic graph
can be reasoned about and built consistently by any consumer.

## Terminology

This project keeps two word-pairs strictly separated and **never crosses them**:

| Concept            | Artifact                     | Shape                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **syntactic tree** | **CSDL** document (XML/JSON) | nested elements & attributes |
| **semantic graph** | **EDM** (after resolution)   | nodes, edges, paths          |

So it is the _EDM_ semantic graph and the _CSDL_ syntactic tree — never a "CSDL
semantic graph." Resolution is the bridge from one to the other.

Two more conventions:

- **"attribute"** is used in the XML sense (the `Type` _attribute_ of a `Property`
  _element_). This avoids awkwardly mixing model and meta-model vocabulary and
  keeps a single word for the thing being classified.
- **"attribute categories"** (not "classes" — `class` is overloaded).

_Semantic graph_ is an established term: compilers speak of an **abstract
semantic graph** (an AST whose name references have been resolved into edges), and
data modeling / knowledge graphs use it for the same idea — entities linked by
typed relationships. The EDM is exactly this for an OData model.

On _meta-model_: CSDL genuinely **is** the meta-model for OData service models —
it is the language in which service models are written. This document does not
claim to be that meta-model; it describes one **facet** of it: how a model's
attributes project into the semantic graph.

## The three attribute categories

Every attribute of a CSDL element falls into exactly one category. The decision
rule:

1. **value** — carries scalar or structured _data_ with no symbolic link to
   another element (`Nullable`, `MaxLength`, `Abstract`, `DefaultValue`, an
   element's own `Name`). Carries no graph information.
2. **reference** — names _exactly one_ model element (`Type`, `BaseType`,
   `EntityType`, `Function`). Resolves to a single target.
3. **path** — an ordered `a/b/c` sequence of named elements, each connected to the
   previous by an _implicit_ reference (`PropertyRef.Name`, `Partner`,
   `NavigationPropertyBinding.Path`, `EntitySetPath`). Resolves to a walk.

Separately, the syntactic tree's **containment** (parent/child _has-a_ nesting —
a `ComplexType` _has_ `Property`s) is itself a reference relationship. It is not
an attribute, but it produces edges too — and is in fact the **majority** of
edges.

## Projection to the EDM semantic graph

| Source              | EDM role    | Notes                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| element             | **node**    | one node per model element                               |
| containment (has-a) | **edge**    | labelled `has`; the bulk of edges                        |
| reference attribute | **edge**    | labelled with the attribute name (`Type`, `BaseType`, …) |
| path attribute      | **path**    | an ordered walk that rides existing edges                |
| value attribute     | **dropped** | no graph information. Could be added to property graphs  |

The catalog stores only the **category**; the graph role above is _derived_ from
it (value→drop, reference→edge, path→path, containment→edge) — fully determined,
which is why role is not stored.

Refinements:

- **Primitive types are intrinsic nodes.** `Edm.String`, `Edm.Int32`, … are nodes
  of the semantic graph even though they are not authored in CSDL — they are
  built-in and "just there." A reference to one (`Type`, `UnderlyingType`) is an
  ordinary edge, so every reference resolves to a node uniformly (ergonomic for an
  API over the graph). A consumer **may elide** primitive nodes to reduce clutter
  — the visualizer does — but that is a _presentation filter_, not a property of
  the graph.
- **Paths thread implicit nodes.** A path `a/b` is really
  `X →(has) a →(Type) A →(has) b`: only the named segments (`a`, `b`) appear in
  CSDL; the connecting types (`A`) are implicit but are real nodes, so the path
  passes through them and rides existing edges rather than cutting across the
  graph.
- **Inheritance is flattened.** The resolved EDM folds `BaseType` members into the
  derived type; path threading follows base types where needed.
- **Collection wrappers decompose.** `Collection(…)` is not a construct of its
  own — it is the wire _syntax_ of a `Type` attribute (e.g.
  `Type="Collection(Edm.String)"`). It splits into two independent facts: the
  **reference edge is just to the wrapped type** (`Edm.String`), identical to a
  non-collection `Type="Edm.String"`; and **collection-ness becomes a synthetic
  value attribute** of the owning element (the reader normalizes it to an
  `is_collection` flag — `$Collection` in CSDL JSON). As a value attribute it
  carries no graph information and drops. So `Type="Collection(X)"` and
  `Type="X"` yield the same edge, differing only in that synthetic flag.
- **Name-or-path unions** (`FunctionImport.EntitySet`) are treated as paths.

## Containment relationships

## Reference attributes

Each table row below names one target element and becomes an edge labelled with the attribute name.
(Targets include intrinsic primitive type nodes, so this is uniform — no exceptions.)

<!-- GENERATED:attributes-reference -->
| Element | Attribute | Card. | Target / Segment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EntityType | BaseType | optional | EntityType |  |
| ComplexType | BaseType | optional | ComplexType |  |

## Path attributes

The most elaborate part of the model: ordered walks through the graph. The **segment domain** column in the table below
described what type of nodes the path can walk through .

_Note: Entries marked `not yet typed` are are not yet specified in this doc nor implemented in code and carried as raw strings (see
`crates/csdl-edm/TODO/path-attribute-resolution-architecture.md`); they are path
attributes by definition and are expected to become typed segments_

_Note: see the resolver's typed segment enum for their usage `crates/csdl-edm/src/edm.rs`_

<!-- GENERATED:attributes-path -->
| Element | Attribute | Card. | Target / Segment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PropertyRef | Name | required | KeyPathSegment | terminal: `PrimitiveType`; descent: `ComplexType`. an entity key |
| NavigationProperty | Partner | optional | BindingPathSegment | terminal: `NavigationProperty`; descent: `ComplexType` |

|  | ReferencedProperty | required | (not yet typed: String) | terminal: `PrimitiveType`; descent: `ComplexType`. resolver gap — stored as String today |
| Function | EntitySetPath | optional | EntitySetPathSegment | head: `BindingParameter` |

|  | AnnotationPath | optional | (not yet typed: String) | terminal: `Annotation`. resolver gap |
|  | ModelElementPath | optional | (not yet typed: String) | spec construct; resolver gap |
<!-- END:attributes-path -->

### Segment domains

Each `Target / Segment` cell above names a _segment domain_ — the set of
node kinds a single segment in that path may resolve to.

<!-- GENERATED:segment-domains -->
- **KeyPathSegment** — `Property`. intrinsic to a single entity type; descends through ComplexType-valued structural properties, terminates at a primitive. Navigation properties are deliberately excluded — keys must be properties of the entity itself, not of related entities (contrast BindingPathSegment, which is the domain that traverses navigation).
- **BindingPathSegment** — `Property` | `NavigationProperty` | `EntityTypeCast` | `ComplexTypeCast` | `EntitySet` | `Singleton` | `EntityContainer`. used by NavigationPropertyBinding.Path/Target and NavigationProperty.Partner; head is a container element in `target` form, properties/navs in `path` form.
- **EntitySetPathSegment** — `BindingParameter` | `NavigationProperty` | `Property`. Function.EntitySetPath / Action.EntitySetPath; starts at the binding parameter.
<!-- END:segment-domains -->

edges, or paths. Listed for completeness.
