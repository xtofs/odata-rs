# CSDL Coverage Gaps

This is the authoritative implementation backlog for remaining CSDL 4.01
coverage work.

Current implemented pipeline:

- reader (JSON/XML) -> parser -> CSDL model -> resolver -> EDM model -> validator

Notes:

- `src/csdl.rs` is now the canonical CSDL model.
- `src/model.rs` and `src/conversion.rs` were removed.

Status legend used below:

- `done`: implemented in current crate.
- `partial`: represented, but not fully resolved and/or validated.
- `missing`: not yet supported in resolver/validation flow.

## Gap Summary

1. Resolver semantic gaps:
   Inheritance, nav constraints/containment/partner, operations, imports,
   bindings, container inheritance, collection-valued terms.
2. Validation depth gaps:
   Only baseline uniqueness/key checks are implemented; most semantic checklist
   rules are pending.
3. Test coverage gaps:
   Need systematic fixture-backed end-to-end and expected-failure coverage.

Related detailed design TODO:

- [path-attribute-resolution-architecture](path-attribute-resolution-architecture.md)
  Resolver-owned typed/resolved path architecture for CSDL path-like
  attributes, with `NavigationPropertyBinding` as a reference implementation.

## 1. Resolver Semantics Gaps

- [ ] Complete inheritance semantics (`EntityType.BaseType`,
      `ComplexType.BaseType`): inherited member visibility plus effective key inheritance and derived-key compatibility checks are implemented; full behavior/validation remains.
- [ ] Navigation semantics: `partner`, `contains_target`, `on_delete`, and
      `referential_constraints` (field mapping in resolver is implemented; semantic consistency checks are pending).
- [ ] Operations: `Function`, `Action`, and operation binding/composability (signature mapping plus initial binding/entity-set-path validation is implemented; deeper semantics are pending).
- [ ] Container features: `FunctionImport`, `ActionImport`, and
      `NavigationPropertyBinding` resolution (initial resolver mapping done; semantic target/operation validation pending).
- [x] Entity container inheritance (`EntityContainer.Extends`) for same-schema container inheritance in resolver.
- [x] Collection-valued term support.

## 2. Validation Gaps

- [ ] Promote key checklist items from
      `docs/Semantic Validation Checklist.md` into executable rules.
- [ ] Add inheritance-related validation (base-type cycles, key compatibility,
      member consistency) (key compatibility is now enforced in resolver; broader validation remains).
- [ ] Add navigation validation (partner consistency, referential constraints,
      containment rules).
- [ ] Add container-level binding/import validation (initial unknown-target checks are implemented; full semantic validation is pending).
- [ ] Add annotation semantic validation (term applicability and target checks).

## 3. Primitive and Type Coverage

- [ ] Expand primitive support beyond the currently implemented subset where
      CSDL inputs require it.
- [ ] Track unsupported primitive names as explicit expected failures with clear
      diagnostics.
- [ ] Introduce typed facet/value unions in parse+serialize+resolver model:
      `MaxLength` (`int | max`), `Scale` (`int | variable`), `SRID` (`int | variable`), and typed `AppliesTo` target set.

## 4. Tests and Compatibility

- [x] Add fixture-backed end-to-end tests for each sample in `data/inputs`:
      parse -> resolve -> validate.
- [x] Add expected-failure tests for unsupported semantics (inheritance,
      operations, nav constraints, imports/bindings).
- [x] Add snapshot tests for XML<->JSON round-trip deltas to make serializer
      changes explicit.
- [ ] Add parity tests for `examples/` entrypoints so API-level behavior is
      stable.

## 5. Packaging Backlog

- [ ] Add crate feature flags so parse/serialize-only users can opt out of
      resolver + validator.
- [ ] Start with in-crate feature gating before considering a hard crate split
      (`csdl` vs `edm`).
- [ ] Define default feature set and compatibility policy for examples and
      public APIs.

## 6. Documentation Hygiene

- [ ] Authoritative spec model lives in `docs/csdl-attribute-catalog.toml`
      (top-level repo) and the rendered `docs/edm-semantic-graph.md`. Keep
      this TODO file focused on delivery tracking; the catalog is the source
      of truth for what CSDL 4.01 expresses.
